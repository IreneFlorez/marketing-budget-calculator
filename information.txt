To follow along with your numbers, you’ll need to pick an amount of time (like one year), and gather these numbers for that time span:

Visits
Leads
Sales
Average sale price
Average lifetime of a customer
1. Calculate the lifetime value of a customer (LTV).
If you sign a new customer, how much revenue will that generate for your company? You’ll need to factor in sale price, how often they repeat, and how long they hang around.
Keep in mind that our formula below is a simple calculation that will give you the amount of revenue generated for the average lifetime of a customer (the end of the life being defined by the customer no longer using your services, not death).

FORMULA: Average sale price per period * Average lifetime of customer  = Lifetime value of a customer
EXAMPLE: $150 per month * 36 months = $5,400 LTV

For Timely, the average sale price is $150 per month for an unlimited amount of users.
An average customer sticks around for 36 months.
Now, this number should change your mindset a bit: Timely is no longer selling to a $150 customer, they’re selling to a $5,400 customer.

2. Calculate the total value of new customers.
How many new customers did you acquire over the year? In sticking with the one-year timeframe, we now need to dig up the number of new customers generated this year.
From there, it’s simple:
FORMULA: Number of new customers * LTV = Total value of new customers
EXAMPLE: 200 * $5,400 = $1,080,000 new revenue generated
Because Timely signed up 200 new clients during the year, they’ve created $1.08 million in new lifetime value. Now we’re talking.

3. Calculate the value of a website visitor.
How much is each website visitor worth from that pool of customers? Pull out the number of website visitors you received this year.
Since we know the amount of new revenue we generated during this time period, we can easily solve for the value of website visitors:

FORMULA: New revenue generated / Number of website visitors = Value of each visitor
EXAMPLE: $1,080,000 / 325,000 = $3.32 visitor value
With 325,000 visits to the website during the full year, Timely now knows that each visitor is worth $3.32 in revenue.
Now that is good, just like I said at the beginning of the article, but it’s good in a numerical sense.

But, here’s the good stuff.
That number we just came to above is really important.
With that number (and I recommend testing it out over different time periods and sources), you understand exactly how much value you’ll bring to the company if you increase web visits by, say, 20%.
But there’s some additional information you should be tracking if you want to improve that visitor value from $3.32 up to $4.
Couple the increase in visits with the increase in value per visitor, and you’re talking about a massive bonus and promotion.
Here is how you can work on increasing the value of each visitor (now that you know the number):

Calculate the visit to lead conversion rate.
What percentage of your visitors become leads over a year?

FORMULA: Number of leads / Number of visitors (over the same period)

EXAMPLE: 11,375 / 325,000 = 3.5% visitor to lead conversion rate

Timely receives 3.5 leads for every 100 visitors to its website.

Calculate the lead to customer conversion rate.
What percentage of your leads turn into customers over a year? The next step in the funnel is to move leads to sales.
This conversion rate tells you how well your team turns leads into customers.
Try out some tests to increase your conversion rates, and stick with the ones that work.
When your conversion rates go up, the value of each lead goes up, and so does the value of each visitor.
FORMULA: Number of customers / Number of leads (over the same period)
EXAMPLE: 200 / 11,375 = 1.75% lead to sale conversion rate

Timely gains, on average, 1.75 customers for every 100 leads it receives through the website.
